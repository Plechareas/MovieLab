• This is a fully functional website about a local movie theater. You can watch whats is playing now, the treding movies and comming soon movies.

• You can also see a mini preview of the movie, actors, genre, a discription and even a trailer so you can get an idea about the whole movie.

• After you decide what you want to see you can creat an account or log in to an existing one if you already registered before and book a ticket about your pref movie.

• Then an e mail with the e-ticket will be send to your account.

PS. Everything in the site is being built by me and and 3 other friends in a university project which was rated 10/10, enjoy :)
